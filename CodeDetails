Each routine (except isBlank()) is declared, defined and invoked
by enclosing its name in a call to the pre-processor macro RS_XML().
This is used to provide a namespace for the routines so that they
don't conflict. (This happened when combining the libxml with code
which had a routine startElement() defined!)


I chose not to use noweb for this package in order to simplify
installation for others.
