<title>Schema, Compiled Code and R bindings</title>

The following are some thoughts on how we can parse XML in a new way
from within R, making use of various different tools.

We start with a given XML schema describing a class of documents
and the associated data types.
We can read this ourselves in R or use 3rd party tools
and then generate code to process such documents.
This could produce S4 classes for representing objects
from these data types.

<para/>
More interestingly however is to generate C++ code for parsing a
document Suppose we have a C++ class that can parse the XML document
and create the relevant objects.  Then we can create bindings to that
C++ class using RGCCTranslationUnit.
And we can create derived classes
