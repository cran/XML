Installing this package can be a little trickier than others for
several reasons.  The package uses libxml, the XML parser that is part
of the Gnome system.  Many systems have a version of libxml installed,
but in some cases, we do not want to use that. By-passing the system
library, requires input from you, the user. Also, there are now two
distribution series of libxml -- 1.8.* and 2.2.* that we support. 
 The possiblity of picking up the system header (include) files and
the wrong library, is complicated by the fact that these include files
are found in different locations depending on whether we are using an
installed on uninstalled version of libxml.  Oh, and yes, it can also
be compiled to use expat, the XML parser by Jim Clark. These different
possible combinations of these can make the installation and run-time
behaviour tricky. It is further complicated by the fact the package
works with both R and S-Plus 5 and S-Plus 6.  However, conceptually it
is not difficult. It is only the different number of possible
combinations.


The package can be configured to use either or both of Daniel
Veillard's libxml library
(ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/libxml/) and Jim Clark's
expat (http://www.jclark.com/xml) library for parsing XML documents.
libxml is used for the tree-based (DOM) parsing and the event-driven
(SAX) parsing.  Expat is used only for the event-driven parsing and is
not necessary if one wishes to use libxml. The support for expat is
older and less well maintained.


Note that the descriptions here are for Unix systems.  See
WindowsInstall for some details for Windows.


If you don't want to use the libxml2 series, then the default
installation should work without any additional work from you.
You can use the regular R installation command
  R INSTALL -c -l <directory/to/install> XML
or directly from the tar file
  R INSTALL -c -l <directory/to/install> XML_0.7-4.tar.gz

The -c and -l flags are explained in the R documentation (see ?INSTALL
within R, the FAQ and the R-intro documents in the distribution.)



Using a non-system version of libxml.
========================

If you want to use a version of libxml that is not installed in the
regular location in your system, you will need to tell the configuration
where to find the header files and the library. The simplest way to to 
do this is to set the environment variables
  LIBXML_INCDIR
and 
  LIBXML_LIBDIR
before invoking the R INSTALL command.

You should set these to the include/ and the .libs/ directory within
the libxml distribution, respectively.  For example, whe I install
using version libxml2-2.2.12 which I have in my ~/XML/ directory, I
set these to

  LIBXML_INCDIR  ~/XML/libxml2-2.2.12/include
and
  LIBXML_LIBDIR  ~/XML/libxml2-2.2.12/.libs

Then, run 
  R INSTALL -c -l <whereve> XML
and it should tell you where it is finding the
