Version 0.6
   
  * xmlDOMApply for recursively applying a function to each node in a tree.

Version 0.5-1

  * simplification of xmlOutputBuffer so that it doesn't put
    the namespace definition in each and every tag.

  * configuration changes to support libxml2-2.3.6
    (look for libxml2, check if xmlHashSize is available)

  * now dropping nodes if the handler function returns NULL.
    Updated documentation.

  * spelling correction in the documentation

Version 0.5
 * xmlOutputBuffer now accepts a connection.   

 * Fixes for using libxml2, specifically 2.2.12.

Version 0.4

 * `namespace' handler in xmlTreeParse is called when a namespace
   declaration is encountered. This is called before the child nodes
   are processed.

 * More documentation, in Tour.

 * xmlValue, xmlApply, xmlSApply, xmlRoot, xmlNamespace, length, names

 * Constructors for different types of nodes: XMLNode, XMLTextNode, XMLProcessingInstruction.

 * Methods for print(), subsetting ([ and [[), accessing the fields
   in an XMLNode object.

 * New classes for the different node types (e.g. XMLTextNode)

 * Event driven parsing available via libxml. Expat is not needed but
   can be used.

 * Document sources can be URLs (ftp and http) when using the libxml parser.

 * Examples for processing MathML and SVG files. See examples/ directory.

 * Examples for event driven parsing.



 * Class of result from xmlTreeParse is XMLDocument.

 * Comments, Entities, Text, etc. inherit from XMLNode
   in addition to defining their own XML<type> class.
